## 🎯 **Implementation Order Rationale**

### **Phase 1: Design System Migration (Priority 1)**
**Duration**: 3 weeks | **Start**: Immediate | **Agent**: Frontend Agent

**Why First**:
- **Foundation Dependency**: All new UI components need SOLID-compliant design system
- **Parallel Opportunity**: Can run while backend improvements continue
- **Critical Path**: Blocks both subsequent modules' frontend development
- **Risk Mitigation**: Establishes UI patterns before complex business logic

**Impact**:
- Enables rapid frontend development for subsequent modules
- Provides consistent UI/UX patterns
- Reduces technical debt in component architecture

### **Phase 2: Dynamic Product Service Module (Priority 2)**  
**Duration**: 5 weeks | **Start**: Week 4 | **Agent**: Backend + Frontend

**Why Second**:
- **Core Business Logic**: Provides the main value proposition of the template
- **Integration Foundation**: Creates user-entity relationships needed by Document Management
- **Business Priority**: Enables complete configurability without hardcoded business rules
- **Revenue Impact**: Core differentiating feature for template sales

**Dependencies**:
- Design System Migration (for UI components)
- Existing user management system (already complete)

### **Phase 3: Configurable Storage System (Priority 3)**
**Duration**: 7 weeks | **Start**: Week 9 | **Agent**: Backend + Frontend

**Why Third**:
- **Infrastructure Foundation**: Provides flexible storage for all file operations
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Vercel Blob, Cloudinary, Google Drive integration
- **Business Flexibility**: Clients choose storage providers based on needs and budget
- **Implementation Order**: Vercel Blob (easiest) → Cloudinary → Google Drive

**Dependencies**:
- Dynamic Product Service Module (for entity-file relationships)
- Design System Migration (for file management UI components)

### **Phase 4: Document Management Integration (Priority 4)**
**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Start**: Week 16 | **Agent**: Backend + Frontend

**Why Fourth**:
- **Enhancement Layer**: Builds on top of Configurable Storage System
- **Document-Specific Features**: Advanced categorization, search, organization
- **Business Value**: Enterprise document management leveraging flexible storage
- **Integration Focus**: Connects storage system with business entities

**Dependencies**:
- Configurable Storage System (for storage infrastructure)
- Dynamic Product Service Module (for user-entity relationships)

## 🔗 **Dependency Management**

### **Critical Dependencies**
```
Design System Migration
    ↓ (Enables)
Dynamic Product Service Module (Frontend)
    ↓ (Provides user-entity relationships)
Configurable Storage System
