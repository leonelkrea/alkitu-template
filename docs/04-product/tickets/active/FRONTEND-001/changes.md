## Change Entries:

### 2025-01-14 22:30 - Frontend-Backend Integration Completed

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/web/src/lib/trpc.ts` - Updated backend URL configuration
- `packages/web/src/components/providers/TrpcProvider.tsx` - Updated tRPC provider port configuration
- `docs/04-product/tickets/FRONTEND-001/README.md` - Updated status to completed

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ **Port Configuration**: Updated frontend tRPC client to connect to backend port 3001
- ‚úÖ **tRPC Integration**: Verified tRPC client properly configured for type-safe communication
- ‚úÖ **Backend Connectivity**: Confirmed backend services operational and accessible
- ‚úÖ **User Interface Analysis**: Verified comprehensive user management interface already implemented

**SOLID Principles Applied:**
- **DIP**: Frontend depends on tRPC abstractions, not concrete backend implementations
- **ISP**: User interface components use specific tRPC hooks, not monolithic API clients
- **SRP**: Each component has single responsibility for specific user operations

**Before/After Example:**

```typescript
// ‚ùå Before (incorrect port configuration)
export const trpc = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [
    httpBatchLink({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000/trpc',
    }),
  ],
});

// ‚úÖ After (correct backend port)
export const trpc = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [
    httpBatchLink({
      url: 'http://localhost:3001/trpc',
    }),
  ],
});
```

**Validation:**
- [x] ‚úÖ Code compiles without errors
- [x] ‚úÖ Backend running successfully on port 3001
- [x] ‚úÖ Frontend running successfully on port 3000
- [x] ‚úÖ tRPC configuration validated
- [x] ‚úÖ User management interface confirmed operational

**Notes:**
- Backend was operational on port 3001, not 3000 as initially expected
- User management interface was already comprehensively implemented with tRPC integration
- Both services running concurrently in development environment
- Type safety maintained across frontend-backend boundary
