## ⚠️ **Critical Considerations**

### **Provider Management**
- **Credential Security**: Encrypt and securely store all provider API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper throttling for each provider's API limits
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track usage and costs across all providers

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Large File Handling**: Implement chunked uploads for files >50MB
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache file metadata and provider responses
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Use appropriate providers for different file types
- **Background Processing**: Async processing for non-critical operations

### **Security Requirements**
- **Access Control**: Proper authorization for file operations
- **Data Privacy**: Compliance with data protection requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all file operations
- **Provider Security**: Secure communication with all external APIs
