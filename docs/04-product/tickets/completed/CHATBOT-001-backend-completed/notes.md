# CHATBOT-001 Implementation Notes

## Frontend Structure

I have created the initial frontend structure for the chat widget. This includes:

-   `packages/web/src/components/public/ChatWidget/ChatWidget.tsx`: The main widget component.
-   `packages/web/src/components/public/ChatWidget/ContactForm.tsx`: The form for starting a new conversation.
-   `packages/web/src/components/public/ChatWidget/ChatInterface.tsx`: The UI for displaying and sending messages.
-   `packages/web/src/components/public/ChatWidget/hooks/useChat.ts`: A hook for managing the chat state and interacting with the backend.

## Next Steps

-   Implement the backend chat service, including the tRPC router and WebSocket gateway.
-   Connect the frontend to the backend and test the real-time messaging.
-   Implement the admin dashboard for managing conversations.
