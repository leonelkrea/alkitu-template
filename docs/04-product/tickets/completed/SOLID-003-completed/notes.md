# Agent Notes - SOLID-003

## üß† Architecture Agent Notes

_Documenting LSP implementation decisions, observations, and findings during SOLID-003 implementation_

### Key Decisions to Document:

- [x] ‚úÖ LSP violation analysis completed
- [x] ‚úÖ Base interface contracts defined
- [x] ‚úÖ Error handling standardization implemented
- [x] ‚úÖ Service lifecycle patterns established
- [x] ‚úÖ Substitutability verification tests created
- [x] ‚úÖ Behavioral contract documentation

### Current Analysis:

```typescript
// LSP VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED:

// ‚ùå Before: Inconsistent error handling
class UserAuthenticationService {
  async validateUser(credentials: any) {
    if (!fullUser.password) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException('User password not found'); // Strengthens precondition
    }
  }
}

// ‚ùå Before: Different validation strictness
class MarketingEmailChannel {
  validateData(data: any) {
    if (data.contentHtml && data.contentHtml.length > 50000) {
      errors.push('contentHtml must be 50000 characters or less'); // Strengthens validation
    }
  }
}

// ‚úÖ After: LSP-compliant implementations
interface IBaseService {
  initialize(): Promise<ServiceResult<void>>; // Never throws
  isHealthy(): Promise<boolean>; // Never throws
  cleanup(): Promise<ServiceResult<void>>; // Never throws
}

interface IEmailChannel<T extends IBaseEmailData> {
  send(data: T): Promise<ServiceResult<EmailDeliveryResult>>; // Consistent return type
  validateData(data: T): ValidationResult; // Consistent validation
}

interface IAuthenticationService {
  authenticate(credentials: any): Promise<ServiceResult<any>>; // No exceptions
  validateToken(token: string): Promise<ServiceResult<any>>; // No exceptions
}
```

### Working Notes:

#### 2025-01-11 18:00 - LSP Violation Analysis Complete

**Findings:**

- **Critical LSP Violation**: Authentication services strengthening preconditions with additional password checks
- **Medium LSP Violation**: Email channels having inconsistent validation strictness between implementations
- **Medium LSP Violation**: Services throwing different exception types for similar error conditions
- **Low LSP Violation**: Repository services inconsistent error handling (some return null, others throw)
- **Behavioral Inconsistency**: NotificationService changing behavior based on optional dependencies

**Questions:**

- How to maintain backward compatibility while fixing LSP violations?
- Should we create new interfaces or modify existing ones?
- How to ensure all future implementations follow LSP automatically?

**Decisions Made:**

- **Decision 1**: Create base service interfaces with strict contracts defining allowed behaviors
- **Decision 2**: Standardize all error handling to use ServiceResult pattern instead of exceptions
- **Decision 3**: Implement comprehensive LSP compliance tests to prevent future violations
- **Decision 4**: Create LSP-compliant reference implementations alongside existing ones for gradual migration
