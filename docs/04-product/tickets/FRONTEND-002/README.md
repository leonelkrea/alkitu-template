## 🎯 Objective

To implement the frontend UI and logic for the new user management features exposed by the SOLID backend.

**Primary Goal**: Implement UI for bulk user operations (delete, update role, update status).
**Secondary Goals**: Implement UI for password reset and user stats.

## 🚨 Problem Description

The backend has been updated with new user management capabilities, but the frontend does not yet have the UI to support them.

### Required State:

The frontend should have a user-friendly interface for managing users, including the new bulk operations and password management features.

### Primary Files (Must be modified):

- `packages/web/src/app/dashboard/users/page.tsx`: Implement the main user management UI.
- `packages/web/src/components/users/UserTable.tsx`: Update the user table to support bulk actions.
- `packages/web/src/components/users/BulkActions.tsx`: Create a new component for bulk action controls.

### Reference Files (Read for context):

- `docs/04-product/FRONTEND-HANDOFF.md`: For understanding the new backend features.
- `packages/api/src/users/dto/`: For understanding the DTOs for the new endpoints.

- [ ] Admins can trigger a password reset for a user.
