## 👥 Agent Roles & Responsibilities

This project is built by a team of specialized AI agents. Each agent has a specific role and set of responsibilities to ensure a clear separation of concerns and a high degree of quality.

- **[Architecture Agent](./01-architecture-agent.md)**: Designs the system architecture, defines data models, and ensures SOLID principles are upheld.
- **[Testing Agent](./02-testing-agent.md)**: Implements and enforces our rigorous testing strategy, including TDD, mutation testing, and quality gates.
- **[Backend Agent](./03-backend-agent.md)**: Develops the NestJS-based backend, including APIs, services, and database integration.
- **[Frontend Agent](./04-frontend-agent.md)**: Builds the Next.js frontend, creating a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **[Documentation Agent](./05-documentation-agent.md)**: Manages and maintains all project documentation, quality systems coordination, and knowledge management.

For a complete overview of best practices that apply to all agents, please see our **[Best Practices Guide](./BEST-PRACTICES.md)**.
