2. **View logs:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/logs.sh
   ```

## üîß NPM Scripts Integration

These scripts are also available through npm:

```bash
# Development
npm run dev:docker              # Same as ./scripts/dev.sh

# Docker management
npm run docker:stop             # Same as ./scripts/stop.sh
npm run docker:logs             # Same as ./scripts/logs.sh
npm run docker:restart          # Same as ./scripts/restart.sh

# Database
npm run db:shell               # Same as ./scripts/db-shell.sh
```

## üìä Service URLs

After running `./scripts/dev.sh`, these services will be available:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:3001/api/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/health
- **MongoDB**: mongodb://localhost:27017/alkitu
- **Redis**: redis://localhost:6379

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Docker not running

```bash
# Make sure Docker Desktop is running
docker info
```

### Port conflicts

```bash
# Stop all containers first
./scripts/stop.sh

# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
lsof -i :3001  # Backend
```

### Database connection issues

```bash
# Check MongoDB container
docker ps | grep mongo

# View MongoDB logs
./scripts/logs.sh mongodb
```

## üßπ Clean Up

To completely clean up Docker resources:

```bash
./scripts/stop.sh
docker system prune -a
```
